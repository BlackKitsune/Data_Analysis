#+++++++ INTRO TO DATA ANALYSIS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
# Question
# Wrangle (Data adquisition + cleaning)
# Explore (Build intuition + find patterns)
# Draw conclusions (statistics or machine learning)
# Communicate (Blog, papper, email, powepoint, conversation)

# Intro to Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks
# Intro to Computer Science
# Intro to Programming with Python

## DATA ADQUISITION: Donwload, access API, Scraping web, combine data
# Data format = CSV (Comma separated values)

# Repressenting a CSV as a list of rows

# Option 1: Each row is a list
csv = [['A1', 'A2'], 
       ['A3', 'A4']]

# Option 2: Each row is a dictionary (with header)
csv = [{'name1' : 'A1', 'name2' : 'A2'}, 
       {'name3' : 'A3', 'name4' : 'A4'}]
       
## Code for reading a csv file and store each row +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

# import unicodecsv

# Option 1: open/close and for loop to create list
#enrollments = []
#f = open('enrollments.csv', 'rb')
#reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)

#for row in reader:
#  enrollments.append(row)
#  
#f.close()
#
#print(enrollments[0])

# Option 2: with open and list for creating the list
#with open('enrollments.csv', 'rb') as f:
#    reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
#    enrollments = list(reader)
#
#print(enrollments[0])

## TEST READ CSV: Create a list for each of the variables +++++++++++++++++++++

import unicodecsv

enrollments_filename = '/Users/isabelfg/Documents/dataset/enrollments.csv'

## Longer version of code (replaced with shorter, equivalent version below)

# enrollments = []
# f = open(enrollments_filename, 'rb')
# reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
# for row in reader:
#     enrollments.append(row)
# f.close()

with open(enrollments_filename, 'rb') as f:
    reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)
    enrollments = list(reader)

print(enrollments[0])
    
### Write code similar to the above to load the engagement
### and submission data. The data is stored in files with
### the given filenames. Then print the first row of each
### table to make sure that your code works. You can use the
### "Test Run" button to see the output of your code.
