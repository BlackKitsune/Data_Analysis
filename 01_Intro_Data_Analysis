#+++++++ INTRO TO DATA ANALYSIS ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
# Question
# Wrangle (Data adquisition + cleaning)
# Explore (Build intuition + find patterns)
# Draw conclusions (statistics or machine learning)
# Communicate (Blog, papper, email, powepoint, conversation)

# Intro to Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks
# Intro to Computer Science
# Intro to Programming with Python

## DATA ADQUISITION: Donwload, access API, Scraping web, combine data
# Data format = CSV (Comma separated values)

# Repressenting a CSV as a list of rows

# Option 1: Each row is a list
csv = [['A1', 'A2'], 
       ['A3', 'A4']]

# Option 2: Each row is a dictionary (with header)
csv = [{'name1' : 'A1', 'name2' : 'A2'}, 
       {'name3' : 'A3', 'name4' : 'A4'}]
       
# Code for reading a csv file and store each row
import unicodecsv

enrollments = []
f = open('enrollments.csv', 'rb')
reader = unicodecsv.DictReader(f)

for row in reader:
  enrollments.append(row)

for row in reader:
  print row
  
f.close()

enrollments[0]

# Avoid using close
with open('enrollments.csv'
